serde_bare

An incomplete implementation of the BARE (https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/bare) encoding format.

Missing types:
    - i128 (in Serde's data model, not in BARE)
    - u128 (in Serde's data model, not in BARE)
    - tagged unions (in BARE, not immediately clear how to integrate with Serde's data model)
